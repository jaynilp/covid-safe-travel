The outbreak has resulted in one of the highest number of deaths in Europe and prompted three nationwide lockdowns. On 9 June, France reopened to vaccinated travellers from most countries, before easing COVID-19 measures further in its final stage of reopening on 30 June. In July 2021, officials declared that the country entered a fourth wave of the pandemic following an increase in cases driven by the spread of the Delta virus variant.</p>",
